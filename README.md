Neovim port of Noctis themes, with support for treesitter.

From the official [README.md](https://github.com/liviuschera/noctis/blob/master/README.md):

Noctis is a collection of light & dark themes with a well balanced blend of warm and cold **medium contrast** colors.

The theme is designed to:

-  be easy on the eyes thus reducing the eye strain
-  give semantic meaning to theme's colors

-  _Noctis Azureus'_ background is a very saturated very dark cold azure
-  _Noctis Bordo's_ background is a very unsaturated very dark warm rose

-  _Noctis Lux'_ background is a very saturated very light warm orange
